# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Healthcare Chatbot MVP - a web-based application that provides AI-powered healthcare assistance through a chat interface. The system will be built using FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy for data persistence, and a Bootstrap-based frontend. The chatbot will be restricted to healthcare-related queries only and include proper authentication and logging mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with the system using email and password, so that I can access the healthcare chatbot securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL return an authentication token
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt with appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user clicks "Use Demo Credentials" THEN the system SHALL auto-fill demo email and password fields
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL transition from login view to chat interface
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the session and return to login view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an AI chatbot through a conversational interface, so that I can get healthcare-related assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat interface with timestamp
2. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL show a "Thinking..." indicator during processing
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in a distinct chat bubble with timestamp
4. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN it SHALL display a welcome message from the AI assistant
5. WHEN messages exceed the chat area THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbot to only respond to healthcare-related queries, so that the system maintains its intended purpose and scope.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a healthcare-related question THEN the system SHALL process it with the AI model
2. WHEN a user asks a non-healthcare question THEN the system SHALL respond with "Sorry, I can only assist with healthcare-related queries."
3. WHEN the system evaluates a query THEN it SHALL use keyword-based filtering as a first gate
4. WHEN calling the AI model THEN the system SHALL use a strict healthcare-focused system prompt
5. IF the AI model attempts to respond to non-healthcare topics THEN the system SHALL override with the refusal message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all chat interactions to be logged securely, so that I can monitor system usage while protecting user privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL log hashed versions of queries and responses
2. WHEN storing logs THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for each interaction
3. WHEN hashing data THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 or HMAC256 for security
4. WHEN accessing the database THEN the system SHALL never store plain text user queries or responses
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database schema if it doesn't exist

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with OpenAI's API for AI responses, so that the chatbot can provide intelligent healthcare assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API key is configured THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4o-mini model for responses
2. WHEN OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to mock responses
3. WHEN calling OpenAI THEN the system SHALL use temperature 0.2 for consistent responses
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with fallback responses
5. WHEN no API key is provided THEN the system SHALL operate in mock mode without errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and visually appealing interface, so that I can easily interact with the chatbot on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a modern, healthcare-themed UI
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL adapt responsively to smaller screens
3. WHEN viewing chat messages THEN they SHALL appear in distinct bubbles for user and AI responses
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display appropriate healthcare iconography and branding
5. WHEN interacting with forms THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback and validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management and documentation, so that the system can be easily deployed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide example environment configuration
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include a complete requirements.txt file
3. WHEN running the application THEN it SHALL serve static files and API endpoints correctly
4. WHEN configuring the database THEN the system SHALL support SQLite by default with configurable alternatives
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive setup and usage documentation
